## Delivery Data:

### Overview
This dataset provides a robust solution for delivery-related datasets, breaking down complex delivery information into structured, manageable tables.

### Project Structure
The normalization script creates three distinct tables:

#### Delivery Person Table:

Contains information about delivery personnel
Columns:

ID: Unique identifier
Delivery_person_ID: Specific identifier for the delivery person
Delivery_person_Age: Age of the delivery person
Delivery_person_Ratings: Performance ratings




#### Order Details Table:

Captures order-specific and environmental information
Columns:

ID: Unique identifier
Order-related details like date, time
Environmental factors such as weather, traffic
Order characteristics (type, vehicle, etc.)
Delivery performance metrics




#### Location Details Table:

Stores geographical information
Columns:

ID: Unique identifier
Restaurant location coordinates
Delivery location coordinates




### Why Use This Data?
1. Data Integrity and Organization

Reduced Redundancy: Eliminates data duplication
Improved Data Management: Easier to update and maintain
Structured Approach: Clear separation of concerns

2. Advanced Analytics Potential
Delivery Person Performance Analysis

Track individual performance metrics
Identify top-performing delivery personnel
Analyze age vs. performance correlations

### Operational Efficiency Insights
